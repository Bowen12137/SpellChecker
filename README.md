# SpellChecker & Translator

`SpellChecker & Translator` is a comprehensive tool that allows users to check the spelling of words in a sentence or file, retrieve word definitions, and get suggestions for misspelled words. It utilizes a combination of a word dictionary (`EnglishWords.txt`) for spell checking and a word definition database (`data.json`) for word meanings. This interactive tool is built with a user-friendly interface, making it accessible for a variety of tasks.

## Features
- **Sentence Spell Checking**: Quickly checks the spelling of each word in a given sentence and suggests corrections for misspelled words.
- **File Spell Checking**: Processes an entire file to check the spelling of each word.
- **Word Suggestions**: For any misspelled word, it suggests the closest possible correction based on word similarity using the `SequenceMatcher`.
- **Word Definitions**: Retrieves the definition or translation of any word from an integrated `data.json` dictionary. If no definition is found, the user is notified.
- **Correction Suggestions**: Provides suggestions for any misspelled word.
- **Interactive Menu**: Offers an easy-to-use menu interface for users to navigate through the tool's various functionalities.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.6 or newer**: The tool is built using Python 3.6+.
- **Files**:
  - `EnglishWords.txt`: A file containing valid English dictionary words, one word per line.
  - `data.json`: A JSON file containing word definitions or translations. The structure should have each word as a key and its definition(s) as a list of strings, like so:
  
    ```json
    {
      "example": ["A representative form or pattern", "An instance of something"],
      "abandoned industrial site": ["Site that cannot be used for any purpose, being contaminated by pollutants."]
    }
    ```

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository** or download the `SpellCheckerTranslator.py` file.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spellchecker.git
   cd spellchecker
   ```
2. **Prepare the required files**:
   - Make sure you have `EnglishWords.txt` (a file containing dictionary words) and `data.json` (containing word definitions or translations).
   - Place these files in the same directory as the `SpellCheckerTranslator.py` script.

3. **Run the Program**:
   Run the program from the terminal using:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the program starts, you will be greeted with a menu. The options available are:

1. **Check a File**: 
   - Input a file path, and the tool will check the spelling of all words in the file, suggesting corrections for misspelled words.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     ┌──────────────────────────────┐
     │ Spell Checker & Translator   │
     │ 1. Check a file              │
     │ 2. Check a sentence          │
     │ 3. Check word meaning        │
     │ 0. Quit                      │
     └──────────────────────────────┘
     ```

2. **Check a Sentence**:
   - Enter a sentence, and the tool will spellcheck each word and provide suggestions for any incorrect words.

3. **Check Word Meaning**:
   - Enter a single word, and the tool will return its definition or translation from `data.json`.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     ┌──────────────────────────────┐
     │ Meaning of 'example':         │
     └──────────────────────────────┘
      1. A representative form or pattern
      2. An instance of something
     ```

4. **Quit**: Exit the program.

### Command-Line Example:
```bash
$ python SpellCheckerTranslator.py
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ Spell Checker & Translator   │
│ 1. Check a file              │
│ 2. Check a sentence          │
│ 3. Check word meaning        │
│ 0. Quit                      │
└──────────────────────────────┘
Enter your choice: 2
Enter sentence to spellcheck: I am runing fast
│ am (spelt correctly)
│ runing not found in dictionary. Did you mean 'running'?
│ fast (spelt correctly)
```

## Future Development Plan

We are excited about the future of the `SpellChecker & Translator` tool! Below are some upcoming features and ideas for improvement:

### 1. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- **Objective**: Enhance user experience by providing a graphical interface for easier interaction.
- **Planned Features**:
  - A window-based interface where users can:
    - Select files or enter text for spellchecking.
    - View highlighted corrections in real-time.
    - Easily access word definitions and suggestions with a click.
  - Interactive buttons for functionalities like "Check Sentence", "Check File", "Check Word Meaning", and "Exit."
  - Status indicators to display progress and results clearly.
- **Technologies**: Possible frameworks to be used include:
  - **Tkinter**: A built-in Python library for basic GUI applications.
  - **PyQt**: A more advanced library for building professional GUI applications.

### 2. Integration of Deep Learning Models (e.g., BERT)
- **Objective**: Improve the accuracy of the spell checker and suggestion engine by integrating machine learning models.
- **Planned Features**:
  - Incorporating models like **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** to:
    - Perform **context-aware spell checking**: Understand the context of words within a sentence to provide more accurate spelling corrections.
    - Improve the accuracy of word suggestions by using a model trained on large amounts of text data.
    - **Semantic-based suggestions**: Instead of purely matching similar words, the model will consider the meaning and context to suggest the most appropriate corrections.
  - Build a model training pipeline to keep the spellchecker up to date with recent trends in language usage.
- **Technologies**:
  - **Transformers** library by Hugging Face for integrating pre-trained BERT models.
  - **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** for deep learning implementation.
  - **NLTK** or **spaCy** for natural language preprocessing.

We believe these advancements will significantly enhance the usability, performance, and intelligence of the tool. Contributions and ideas on these planned features are highly encouraged.
